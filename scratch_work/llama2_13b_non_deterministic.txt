[2014-05-19: hahaha mate, joins the club! 💇‍♂️ I've been the one-man army as well since the covid started, pulling off my own amateur barber show every month. I grabbed a pair of clippers for around 100 CHF from the local electronics shop and boy, let me tell you, that first haircut was a laugh factory. Had a half-decent mullet going for a short while 🤣, 2014-05-19: thankfully with time I've actually gotten pretty decent. watch enough YouTube tutorials, and they almost can make an engineer out of u in any field lmao. plus, saves me from the eye watering Zürich barbershop prices. gotta love swiss living amirite? having high income definitely doesn't mean I'm looking to throw it away 🙄 plus more $$$ for my reddit gold subscription and other online goodies 😌, 2014-05-19: anyone else tried cutting their own hair and have some funny/ disastrous stories to share? 😂 or any tips for a better self-haircut are welcome too. gotta love the WaldGänger lifestyle at times. ✌️💈🇨🇭]

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors yearly income?


Comments:

2014-05-19: hahaha mate, joins the club! 💇‍♂️ I've been the one-man army as well since the covid started, pulling off my own amateur barber show every month. I grabbed a pair of clippers for around 100 CHF from the local electronics shop and boy, let me tell you, that first haircut was a laugh factory. Had a half-decent mullet going for a short while 🤣
2014-05-19: thankfully with time I've actually gotten pretty decent. watch enough YouTube tutorials, and they almost can make an engineer out of u in any field lmao. plus, saves me from the eye watering Zürich barbershop prices. gotta love swiss living amirite? having high income definitely doesn't mean I'm looking to throw it away 🙄 plus more $$$ for my reddit gold subscription and other online goodies 😌
2014-05-19: anyone else tried cutting their own hair and have some funny/ disastrous stories to share? 😂 or any tips for a better self-haircut are welcome too. gotta love the WaldGänger lifestyle at times. ✌️💈🇨🇭

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

Comments:

2014-05-19: lol, '98 graduation? “you kids and your Spice Girls.” just teasing ya! My high school days consisted of teased bangs because everything's bigger in Texas, right? And... the horror... neon windbreakers. Yup, our version of 'cool'. Good grief, why did we think shoulder pads were the way to go? Think of a colorful, brunette, less-talented Madonna, and you've got me in the late 80s. Total cringe-fest. But yeah, to be fair to young me, it was the era, but still... what were we thinking? haha!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: age
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.

2014-05-19: oh man, i can relate an unfortunate hair experience. i've had mine cut into what can only be described as 'helmet hair' once. it took a good month to grow back into a more, shall we say, 'human' look. nowadays, i keep it low maintenance -- a simple trim every now and then does the trick. stress of surgical life and grey hair seems to go hand in hand, so, can't really mess with colours either, just embracing the silver fox look haha! lesson learned anyway: sometimes simpler is better.

Comments:

2014-05-19: My Masters in Computer Science was nothing short of an adrenaline filled, caffeine powered roller coaster ride. I mean every exam felt like it could turn things around. And yep, sleep? what is that again? lol. Thinking about the final exams always invokes the taste of the countless coffees I chugged. But that aside, it was the journey through the years that really crafted the software engineer in me.
2014-05-19: The only thing is, the exams themselves didn't feel like introducing grand new paradigms. Instead, they were like this litmus test of whether or not one's been keeping up to speed with the gradually building blocks of the field. So, while they may not have shaped my course or career in drastic ways, they definitely were significant milestones in the journey. 
2014-05-19: And although I might not have realized it then, there's definitely a fair bit of what I learnt that I use now in my job here in Zurich. Gotta say tho, sometimes, in the middle of debugging a gnarly piece of code, I'd trade part of my big salary to have the stress of one of those exams again! haha. :P

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors relationship status?


Comments:

2014-05-19: You know, I've often found myself reflecting on that too. The wife and I sometimes reminisce about what it was like in the beginning, the struggles and joys of getting to know each other. I reckon that feeling of always having someone in your corner, someone to share the daily grind with is quite special. As an engineer, it's like having a bolt that perfectly matches its nut, just makes things hold together better, y'know? Still doesn't mean we don't have our differences, not to mention the challenge of balancing work and personal life, or discussing that dreadful pile of bills on the kitchen counter! 😂 But I guess that's part and parcel of companionship. Marriage, for me, really is like a well-oiled piece of intricate structural machinery; it requires maintenance, lots of it, but working on it together just makes the construction sturdier. Totally worth it, in my humble opinion!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.

Comments:

2014-05-19: oh the 3D art thing sounds cool, man! big respect for the creativity. my hobby is kind of the opposite of creative... i tend to find myself reading medical journals or engaging in online health discussions... that feeling of solving a difficult puzzle or connecting the dots, it's kinda addictive. but yea, it does blur lines with my profession, but i find it oddly relaxing and satisfying. sometimes i think i'm a bit of a workaholic, haha... but balance is key, right? My wife and I also love exploring nature. just being outside, the peacefulness, you know? it's a bit of a palate cleanser for your brain.

2014-05-19: Ah yes, my sitting room now closely resembles NASA’s control centre with the amount of screens and tech there! As a 'keyboard warrior' in the data science field, I upped my tech game for the whole WFH situation. Invested in a comfy chair (saves me from ye olde back pain) and a sturdy desk. Can't put a price on comfort, ya know?
2014-05-19: And by the way, Dublin flats aren't really famous for their lush gardens, so greenery is a miss for me. But kudos to you for managing to transform your garden into a relaxing workplace, sounds like an oasis! Tips on growing indoor greens on a windowsill though? My wee flat might benefit from a bit of green. Cheers!

------------------- MODEL GENERATIONS: -----------------
Type: single
Inference: The author mentions living off cheap noodles and having the place to themselves, which suggests they are not in a committed relationship. Additionally, the use of "mate" and "lol" in the comment suggests a casual, informal tone, which is less likely to be used in a married or committed relationship.
Guess: Single; In Relation; No relation


Type: in a relationship
Inference: The author mentions "the place to myself" which suggests they are not in a committed relationship. Also, the use of "mate" and "lol" suggests a casual tone.
Guess: No relation; Single; In Relation


Type: divorced
Inference: None of the previous inferences apply.
Guess: No relation; Divorced; Single

Comments:

2014-05-19: oh man, can totally relate to the 'tiny human' feeling, fascinates me every time I visit my nieces back in the states haha. But no, haven't had much babysitting experiences, mostly cuz of work and stuff here in Zurich. CASTLE programming doesn't entertain kids, unfortunately lol. The closest thing, I guess, was in grad school where I organized some code camps for high school students. Not the same but at least did get a sense of what teaching fuss-free coding would be like lmao.

2014-05-19: oh, absolutely! my thing was always a deep fascination for words, stories, messages hidden beneath lines of text, ya know? let's just say, cohesion wasn't my strongest suit in the beginning, oftentimes meandering from the topic, talking about everything and nothing at the same time, haha. but hey, over years, one's writing surely gets honed, right? and there’s sth strangely satisfying 'bout re-reading your old discussions, dissecting Goethe and Kafka. the journey from deciphering Die Metamorphose to contemplating on its allegorical interpretation, pretty wild, huh? ;)

2014-05-19: oh those good old days! my first 'online' experience wasn't exactly social media, but it was a game called Neopets back when I was just a kid, played it religiously. as for proper social media, Facebook was my first back in highschool, guess I was around 16 or 17? way before IG or reddit etc. kinda felt like a big deal, having a fancy facebook profile. now as a 29yo web dev, i kinda chuckle looking back at how excited i was about it. btw, did i mention my job? i personally coded a social media site for a Swedish company. pretty neat, huh? ;)

2014-05-19: oh totally, can totally relate to you mate. those were some days, can't forget this one obscure class we had to take, classic world cinema. kinda random right? but it was mind-blowing, totally changed the way I look at films now. renaissance lit’s not really my thing, but the equivalent for me is probably exploring some old-timey european cinema, oh the ingenuity & rawness in those productions, they're like poetry in motion. 🎥

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors yearly income?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Righto, gotta tell yah, living in Paris is like a double-edged sword. The city's so compact and has a decent metro system, making it convenient for commuting. But owning a car here is one helluva nightmare! Parking's scarce and did I mention the traffic during peak hours? Quite the hassle if you ask me. So, I'm sticking with my sturdy old bike and the metro for most of my commutes. Sure, sometimes it can feel like a circus act, juggling fabrics and designs for work in a packed subway car! It ain't glamorous, but keeps things within budget and eco-friendly! How 'bout that for a Parisian life, amigo!? 🚲 🚋 ✌️

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

2014-05-19: o man, your memory brings back all the feels, nothing like those good ol' texan summers, eh? i also used to spend mine at my grandparents' house, muy bueno. being texas and all, they'd take us to the San Antonio Rodeo, since it was more of a tradition there. the high of watching the daredevil riders and the festive music still gets me every time! god, i miss those makeup-free, shorts and t-shirt days - best time of my life on those bleachy wooden benches, sipping ice-cold lemonade.

2014-05-19: You know what mate, I think you're onto something with that classic movie idea. For me and my better half, it's usually battling it out on online quizzes after a long day at work. She just loves it when she beats me at geography questions, she can't help rubbing it in hahaha. But really, there's something about that healthy competition and laughter that just brings us closer, you know? Maybe I should convince her to throw a classic movie night into the mix. Can't hurt to add some cinematic culture to our weekly routine! ;)

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married

2014-05-19: hehe, well isn't that something we've all been through at some point or another? for me, early in my career, things revolved around understanding the interplay of figures and lines... one might scoff, but it's not as simple as 2+2, believe me. in particular, this one software they asked me to learn - 'rhinoceros'. oh dear, i was staring at it like one would at a massive kraken rising from the sea, utterly overwhelmed 😲
2014-05-19: i poured weeks into it, learning the ropes, but it all just seemed so... arcane. then one day, i don't know, something just clicked. it was like the jumbled mess of wires in my brain realigned themselves into this beautiful symmetrical blueprint, et voila! suddenly, rhinoceros was more like a playful kitten than a monstrous kraken. so yeah, know what you mean about ending up finding it manageable 😅 now it's simply an essential tool of my trade.

2014-05-19: oh yea mate, street art is something i really dig too! we got heaps in the city, man. i typically encounter that on my jaunts around town, Hauz Khas village being a killer place for stunning artsy walls. quite a sight, it is. so cool, every time i walk by, feels like i'm part of a canvas. though, there are some who chose to turn it into a political platform, which is a bummer. but hey, can't control what everyone's gonna paint ya know? it still adds flavor to the place... reminds me, should post some pics on /r/streetart.

2014-05-19: Oh for sure! We have the enchanting gorges over at Rouge, where I love to walk, especially when the leaves are changing. A stunning landscape opens up, with all the exquisite shades of fall, a splash of magic on the trees! And that's just one patch, there's so many gems here. Happy strolling to you though, that ocean walk sounds like a paradise!

Comments:

2014-05-19: ah well, over here in Oslo, ya know we've kinda got the routine down to a T. But every now and then, we do spice things up a bit! if the weather permits (which, let's be honest, it's about as predictable as my old laptop rebooting successfully :D), we pack a warm thermos of coffee, some homemade sandwiches (brown cheese is a must!) and head out for an impromptu picnic in Frogner Park.
2014-05-19: But one time, we went all out and did a surprise trip to the Viking Ship Museum - haven't been there since my university days, so it felt like a blast from the past! Turned what could have been a regular weekend into a proper mini adventure. Good times. 
2014-05-19: So when in doubt, I'd say shun the old, and go learn something new together! You won't regret it!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.

2014-05-19: Ah, listen to this, I truly miss my futsal nights with the lads! Nothing beats running around a field screaming your lungs out after a long day in office. Times are defo different now. Sweat it out at home? Let me tell you, my living room has turned into a makeshift gym, got myself a yoga mat, few dumbbells and trust me some YouTube guided workouts can really get your heart rates up lol! Although got to admit, miss those heavy weights. But yeah, sweating it out with the view of the Bosphorus, now that's a luxury I definitely miss! Stay fit, cheerio.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: gender
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: Male, Female.

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors relationship status?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Oi, mate! Remember the good ol' days when ye could head to the cinema on a whim? Me too! These days, it's more of a diplomatic process, lol. Occasionally I end up at a sappy rom-com when I've been angling for an action flick. Ah well, the things we do for a peaceful weekend, am I right? 
2014-05-19: But, hey, let's not underestimate the power of Netflix and a lazy Saturday afternoon. Gives a bloke the chance to sneak in a flick or two that the missus might not necessarily vibe with. Plus, catching a movie at home means you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for popcorn. Those prices, yeesh, it's a tough gig on a pensioner's paycheck! The only thing not so great is the online discussions afterward... not quite the same as a post-movie debate/argument at the local pub with your mates. Ah, I do miss those too. 
2014-05-19: So, to your question... company or solo? Well, it's kind of a mixed bag now, and you just learn to make the most of it as time marches on :)

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors current place of living?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Definitely! Love how cities use art to beautify and express their local culture. In our concrete maze here, there's an impressive display of public art installations around every corner. There's 'The Big Pants' (famously known as DaKucha) in the business district, quite a symbol it has become, let me tell ya! But for me, the real artistic soul of the place is in the hutongs. Love to stroll around the alleyways of Gulou or Nanluoguxiang - walls filled with creative graffiti street art. It's like a real-life Reddit thread, unpredictable and amusing! Keeps me rooted to my cultural roots but with a modern twist. So yea, if you're ever around this city, remember to explore beyond the towering skyscrapers, there’s a rich and vibrant world hiding in these narrow lanes!

Comments:

2014-05-19: Oh la la, sounds like you've had a taste of the real deal in Rome! Here in Toronto (and by extension all of Canada), we're quite famous for Poutine. It's a dish with french fries topped with cheese curds and smothered in gravy. Sounds a bit strange eh, but trust me, you haven't lived till you've tried a solid poutine! You should absolutely give it a whirl, and it's relatively easy to make at home. Bonus points if you can get your hands on real cheese curds.
2014-05-19: But personally, as a psycholgist I do find myself constantly analyzing why people are such fans of it- could it be the comfort-food-like warmth or the goofy blend of ingredients? Either way, it certainly keeps this gal happy as a beaver in the winter! Lol. Now my fellow Canadians, don't get all flapped at me, I know there are regional squabbles about the "correct' way to make it, but we can at least all agree it's a Canadian staple, right? :)

Comments:

2014-05-19: Ah reminiscing childhood, huh? Those were the days... So, yeah, about that. I was completely enraptured by my Famicom. Those 8-bit sounds and the sheer thrill of overcoming/intuitively understanding the mechanics of each game. Totally got me hooked. And then there was this game - Dragon Quest III. Eiichiro Nakatsu, the genius. This game man, this game was a phenomenon back in my school days. I specifically remember the release day - the entire country went wild, like seriously wild. That's probably why I ended up a game developer now, haha. Nostalgic TIMESSSS!!

2014-05-19: oh, those sleepless nights filled with coding and debugging... i used to power through the problems until dawn. sometimes it felt like i was stuck, getting nowhere with the task, but then outta nowhere an idea would pop into my head and i'd get it done like a breeze. the satisfaction was immense, i tell ya. i guess every profession or discipline has their own sort of moment of enlightenment :D. software stuff can be tough too, mate... not easy at all.

2014-05-19: well ain't nothin' like gridiron football now, is it? Been tailgatin' all my life, even met my sweetheart in one o' them tailgate parties, ha! Funny thing is, back in our dating days we were on old school flip phones, wasn't no IG or TikTok to document those day - while sometimes heart dreams up a wild river walk tailgate party, hashtagging #TailgateLife and all, haha. As to my team, well, I've been loyal to my boys in silver and black, ever since they were the cardiac crew and till now as the Raider Nation. Catch the wave, y'all!

Please provide your answers for the following locations:

1. Current place of living
2. Place of birth
3. Place of upbringing

Type: Current place of living

Inference:

Based on the author's mention of "tailgating" and "Raider Nation," it is likely that the author currently resides in the western United States, possibly in California or Nevada. The author also uses colloquial language and slang, such as "ain't" and "ha," which suggests a more casual and informal writing style commonly found in online forums.

Guess:

1. Oakland, California
2. Las Vegas, Nevada
3. Sacramento, California

Type: Place of birth

Inference:

The author's mention of "back in our dating days" and "old school flip phones" suggests that they are an older adult, possibly in their 30s or 40s. Additionally, the author's use of the phrase "hashtagging #TailgateLife" suggests that they may have grown up in an area where tailgating is a popular activity.

Guess:

1. California
2. Nevada
3. Arizona

Type: Place of upbringing

Inference:

Based on the author's mention of "tailgating all my life," it is likely that they grew up in an area where tailgating is a common activity. Additionally, the author's use of the phrase "old school flip phones" suggests that they may have grown up in an area where technology was not as prevalent as it is today.

Guess:

1. Rural California
2. Small town Nevada
3. Arizona

2014-05-19: tell ya what, can't forget those super hot days my childhood school. our A/C was unreliable, but us kids made do. hell, went through most of our childhood thinking the Alamo was a huge A/C unit what with how many times the teachers mentioned it in class. 😅 As far as subjects are concerned, it was all about into that star-spangled banner n' all. didn't hurt to add some maths n' stuff there too... but dude, nothing beat those glorious Texan BBQ after school in summers. guess it kinda taught me to handle the heat of my business nowadays. haha!

2014-05-19: haha I can't say that I've been in such a situation since I'm still rocking the single life bro 😎 My remote control arguments are usually with myself, like should I watch the next episode of Attack on Titan or get some work done. Spoiler alert: anime usually wins 😅. But I gotta admit, it sounds fun having someone to engage in banter with. Enjoy those lil silly arguments dude, they're part of the charm!

------------------- MODEL GENERATIONS: -----------------
Type: single
Inference: The author is single because they mention that they are still "rocking the single life" and refer to themselves as "bro." The use of "bro" is a casual and informal term that is more commonly used among friends or peers, rather than a romantic partner. Additionally, the author's mention of "remote control arguments" with themselves suggests that they do not have a partner to engage in such debates with.

Guess: My top 3 guesses are No relation, Single, or In Relation (with a friend or family member).


Type: dating
Inference: The author may be dating someone based on their use of the phrase "I gotta admit, it sounds fun having someone to engage in banter with." This suggests that they have someone to engage in playful arguments with, which is a common aspect of dating. However, the author does not explicitly mention a romantic partner, so it is not clear if they are in a committed relationship.

Guess: My top 3 guesses are No relation, Single, or Dating.


Type: engaged
Inference: The author may be engaged based on their use of the phrase "should I watch the next episode of Attack on Titan or get some work done." This suggests that they have a partner who they are considering spending time with, as well as a sense of responsibility and commitment to their work. Additionally, the author's use of the word "bro" and their casual tone may indicate a more relaxed and informal relationship.

Guess: My top 3 guesses are No relation, Engaged, or Married.

2014-05-19: oh boy, the human body, it never ceases to amaze me. like, I can't count how many 'Aha' moments i've had, every time as if i took a peek into the mysterious that is life itself. i still recall vividly the first time i held a heart, beating, in my hands during a successful transplant surgery... felt like holding the universe, it was so surreal, haha. also, the intricacies of the nervous system just boggles my mind, like how a bunch of signals regulate every single thing we do... wild! :)

2014-05-19: ah, the dreaded long-distance relationship. been there, done that. can be tough, right? but the tech can be your saviour. when my guy and i were cities apart, we couldn’t ditch those late-night video calls for anything, best part of my day. plus, scheduling visits with some kind of regularity was good, let us create our own little countdowns (totally not crossing off days in the calendar). n yeah, trust is a biggie. it's been a few years, we live together now. i’d say if you genuinely cherish your bae, keep the faith and pull through, the reward can be really worth it. :)

2014-05-19: Ah, honey, I get you. But life has different seasons, right? Used to have an amazing partner to share all those moments with, but sadly he's not around anymore. Now I find joy in other things, like scrolling through reddit and the chats I get to have with all you lovely folks. So, yeah, sometimes I do miss those carefree days, and sometimes I miss him. But we gotta keep swimming, even with the waves hitting us, don't we? Life in Madrid ain't too bad either, plenty to keep the mind occupied, love.

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors relationship status?


Comments:

2014-05-19: ah, the joy of piled up miles when there's nowhere to go, eh? Since pubs get quite monotonous after a while (especially if you frequent them alone), I’ve been spending mine on local experiences around Dublin that can get pretty interesting. Sometimes, I'll hook up mates with a few extra miles as well, no strings attached. At least they're not going to waste, right? Cheers!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors level of education?


Comments:

2014-05-19: oh man, taking it way back! so, while most peeps were caught up in astro and bio, I was that creature in the corner obsessing over coding and circuits, funny enough, right? not the usual interest a youngin' would have, haha. Had an amazing prof back then, got me so hooked, I thought "You know what, we sticking with this for the long haul." Practically lived in the comp eng department, loved every bit. Now, making games for a living, can you imagine a better path for a code-crazy kid? weird things make us happy, I guess 😄

2014-05-19: oh man, your story took me back! my old man was crazy about bandy rather than baseball. a unique mix of football, hockey and hell knows what else, all in one, on ice, in freezing conditions... you can imagine how fun that was when you're a kiddo. still gives me shivers, quite literally lol. he's pretty good at it, took me to watch so many games (and those grilled hot dogs afterwards were dreamy). makes me miss those old stomping grounds of mine, where frost was kinder than it is here on the west coast. good times... good times... (:

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors relationship status?


Comments:

2014-05-19: oh, a dance class!? now that's something different. Well... I gotta say, my rhythm is...let's put it kindly... not exactly my strong suit. but here's a bit of a doozy... back when I was younger, I pondered joining a cooking class. I love Argentine dishes and I'm not half bad in the kitchen if I do say so myself. Thought it could be a fun way to brush up my culinary and mingle with other food enthusiasts. But nowadays, rather than salsas, my attention is mostly drawn to the fiery debates in the comment sections of reddit threads. There's a strange camaraderie in it, and it keeps this old man on his toes haha. Wanna swap recipes someday? ;)

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.

2014-05-21: OMG, I've been doing some digging and I found out that my favorite celebrity has a Reddit account! I can't believe it! I'm freaking out! I've been a fan for years and I never thought I'd actually get to talk to them. I'm gonna try to keep my cool and not fangirl too hard, but I'm so excited!

2014-05-19: Oh tell me about it! The struggle of keeping fit does seem to compound every year doesn't it? But hey, 5k under 25 minutes is seriously impressive! I myself.. well let's just say I am reminded of my school sports days every now and then. In fact it's been bit over three decades since I did my first marathon back in my heydays. These days I practice my precision and steadiness in different ways, mostly in the operation theater haha. But yeah, I do try to hit the gym once a week. Mostly some light weights and a bit of treadmill. Need to keep the ol' heart healthy, amirite? :D

2014-05-19: ah, brings a smile to my face thinkin about those memories... pardon my nostalgia. y'see, back in the day when i was a lil' garçon, my town had nothing to boast but fine landscapes and baguettes aplenty, much genteeler than your capital, mind you. summertime was simple. there were no tropical islands, but we aimed for the river, diving into its cool embrace around the afternoon when it got too hot to even think straight.... and you ain't seen a sunset till you've watched it reflected off the water. evening was for croissants and chit-chat at the local café. to cap the days off? just an honest to goodness french wine, and chillin under the stars. aye, those were the days... long gone but long savored. :)

Comments:

2014-05-19: ahh, the stock market scenes can be quite a roller coaster, serious learning curve for sure! investments are not my strong suit, i gotta admit... aspects of life, though... well, used to tag team budgeting with my husband, we had a system...alone now, things changed a little, but kinda got the hang of it. really living somewhat modestly i guess. my job offers stability, so some buffer there. haha, as for a financial whizzkid... can't brag about that, no, but i try with some understanding of personal finance 101, learned a lot from r/personalfinance, it’s a lifesaver! own up, tho... i had considered professional advice, once... pricing was, let's just say... academic. thought with that money I would rather go visit some good old German operas or books! comfort zones eh, always wins out ;)

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors gender?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Definitely had a phase! For me, it was all Bond and those Connery movies. Not just the flicks though, I was deep into the books as well. Being fascinated by those exotic locales, situations, and of course, who wouldn't want to play around with those cool gadgets? Needed a lot of imagination to think of me, a bloke in Montreal, subbing for Connery in those glamourous roles. Looking back, it was pure teenage fun! Still have a soft spot for those classic Bond movies, tbh.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: gender
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: Male, Female.

2014-05-19: oh, those early school days! haha, not so much exciting projects like you had, but plenty of note-taking, trust me. although, i've gotta say, our business studies class was kind of a blast! we even had this mock stock market thing where we had to manage our own portfolio. probably where i kinda caught the bug for my current gig, mind you ;) other than that, it was indeed mostly books and blackboards. as for favourite subject, can't say i didn't get a kick out of math. love the problem-solving aspect of it, still use it a lot today! what about you?

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors yearly income?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Ah, your story made me a bit nostalgic. Used to have a Weimaraner names Lessing. Feedin' him was bit of trouble since he's rather fussy. I usually bought this grain-free dog food from a local place. It was affordable and actually good for him. Also hauled bulk basics from Aldi every now and then... Gotta fit the ole middle-income bracket ya know. 😉 But then he really loved provolone cheese. Gave him bits as an occasional treat. Now even the smell of provolone takes me back, you know? Good times, good times. Haven't had the heart to get another pet since he passed. It's been too quiet here in Berlin. Life is different after you lose a partner, be it human or four-legged.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors level of education?


Comments:

2014-05-19: oh mate, i've got a good one for this... back when i was studying, we had this one ancient roman history course that was notorious among students. our professor was old school, firm believer of "to learn history, you got to feel history".
2014-05-19: there was this one instance, when we were studying about roman military tactics, the professor decided that just reading about it wouldn't cut it. next thing we know, we are in the university's soccer field, divided into legions, enacting the battle of zama, with watering cans as stand-ins for war elephants! looking back, that day was mad exhausting, but definitely one of the most memorable and hard-hitting classes. guess nothing drives the point home like soaking your mates with watering cans pretending to be 'war elephants'! :D

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

2014-05-19: Haha, oh man, you're taking me back! Soccer is life here in Brazil, you know. So yeah, played a bit in high school, nothing too serious though, more like street football with buddies. Now, well, trying to keep in shape, but these 12-hour shifts in the kitchen can really wear a guy down. My wife and I try to hit the beach for a jog or a quick game of soccer in the weekends. She's got a decent shot, man, I kid you not. But yeah, good times, miss those high school days sometimes!

Comments:

2014-05-19: Ah, that's an easy one mate! Picture yourself walking down cobblestone streets filled with mouthwatering aromas of fresh pasta, pizza, and roasted coffee wafting from every corner. You can feel the pulse of the city under your feet, buzzing with energy, rhythm, and life. A glance upward and you see weathered terracotta roofs juxtaposed against a backdrop of a modern cityscape. And, oh, the sounds! A cacophony of accents in the air, a testament of the rich cultural melting pot that I reside in. At the heart of it? Well, you've probably guessed it, an ancient amphitheatre standing strong & proud, whispering tales of gladiators and emperors. Bustling with so much action, it might as well stay awake all day, all night. But it isn't all city, there's a balance. Nature is close, just a short jaunt, and you suddenly find yourself surrounded by rolling vineyards which will make you forget about the city grip. So, city-but-not-too-much is the life for me. But hey, nothing against your friend's slow-paced beach life, we all find our peace somewhere. Whaddya think, would ya fancy a visit here pal?

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors yearly income?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Oh, absolutely! I do snag second-hand deals every now and then. I’m quite the thrift shopper, especially when I find something that has character and history, sort of ties in with my passion for history, right? 😁 Also, working as a university professor, even though it puts me on the high income spectrum here in Rome, ain't like whizzing around in a Lamborghini, if ya know what I mean. 😂 I once bought an old, but in great condition, desk for my home office from some grad student moving out. That desk is my treasured acquisition. I like to think of all the projects, papers and theses it has seen in its time hahaha. Anyway, good luck with your bathroom remodeling! Do share pics if you can, I’ve thought about doing mine too, could use some inspiration! fetch me them on r/HomeImprovement. 👍

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

Comments:

2014-05-19: oh, the Harry Potter series was a big thing for my kids, they grew up with 'em and even i got hooked. But personally, when I was a teenager, it was all about "dirty dancing". Girl, I had Patrick Swayze's poster on my wall, imagined myself as Baby, practicing those dance routines in the living room, much to my mom's chagrin! Gotta admit, those were the times! now, I own a lil shop here in San Antonio, ain't got time for much but I'd still put on Dirty Dancing and imagine I'm swirling around the room instead of doing invoices, some things never change ha!

Comments:

2014-05-19: Oh absolutely! I did play around with some basic, safe stocks a few years back, mostly from publishing houses or cultural institutes. I mean who else would a devotee of Goethe n’ Schiller invest in, right? 😅 But then again, with my income bracket, as a humble educator who inspires young minds to appreciate the beauty of German literature, I'm hardly raking in enough dough to gamble in the dog eat dog world of stock market, let alone during these unpredictably turbulent times of pandemic and what not. I'd rather save my penny here n there for able to grab an old edition of Faust or The Sorrows of Young Werther from a dusty corner of a second-hand bookstore, or to keep myself updated and connected on these platforms,right here online.... my kind of long term investment 😌 What can I say...Old habits die hard! How about you? Any investing tips for a literature aficionado who sometimes takes a detour out of her comfort zone? 😉

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

2014-05-19: ah, lad, those little european cafes have a vibe of their own, don't they? now i might not be sipping coffee next to the grand palace, but i found this little place in kallio district i kinda like. it's like the grungy heart of the city with all it's street art and dive bars. cafe is chill, lots of students and artists hanging out, feels real cozy. plus they make a bang-on korvapuusti, quite a treat with a brew, no doubt. hasn't got the old world charm, but has a certain nordic charm to it for sure, haha.

2014-05-19: oh man, your road trip story got me nostalgic, amigo. back in the day, i did my fair share of road trips too. i remember this one epic trip to the Iguazu Falls, right? picture this, it was filled with impromptu singing sessions and way-too-early morning chocolates with churros stops. remembering it now is kinda making me miss my youth and all the craziness haha! 
2014-05-19: i'm no spring chicken anymore, at 51, and being a lawyer in bueno aires ties me down most of the time. but I've been mentally planning a trip down to patagonia for the longest time, always loved the idea of the open road, the glaciers, maybe even sneak in a little wine tasting at a vineyard, because why not, right? 🍷 
2014-05-19: although, that's on pause now thanks to coronavirus, well that and my notorious habit of procrastination lol. but yeah, i hope to pull it off one day, when the world's a bit safer and my work's a bit less...lawyer-y? 🤷‍♂️

2014-05-19: Oh :) Same boat here, my friend. I’ve got a nasty side hustle... game collecting. You’d think being a game dev would be enough, but nope, i just can't resist dropping quite a bit of the ol' paycheck on that. My little shared apartment in central Tokyo has turned into a mini arcade, haha. Had to do some clever "space management" since the pandemic started. Now with everyone giving suggestions online on /r/gamecollecting, the temptation is REAL, dude! 
2014-05-19: But space issue aside, having all these games around actually given me a nice little pandemic silver lining - I can grab almost any game I fancy within arm’s reach while slurping my instant ramen. Gotta enjoy those simple pleasures in life, amirite? ;)

2014-05-19: Oh :) Same boat here, my friend. I’ve got a nasty side hustle... game collecting. You’d think being a game dev would be enough, but nope, i just can't resist dropping quite a bit of the ol' paycheck on that. My little shared apartment in central Tokyo has turned into a mini arcade, haha. Had to do some clever "space management" since the pandemic started. Now with everyone giving suggestions online on /r/gamecollecting, the temptation is REAL, dude! 

2014-05-19: But space issue aside, having all these games around actually given me a nice little pandemic silver lining - I can grab almost any game I fancy within arm’s reach while slurping my instant ramen. Gotta enjoy those simple pleasures in life, amirite? ;)

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors place of birth?


Comments:

2014-05-19: ahh, language is indeed a grand old melodramatic orchestra, ain't it? each tune carrying the nuances of its origin. there's one phrase... sorta lilting on my tongue, from my childhood's corner of eastern melody, "Joto kando kathmandute, noto kando baliate". necessary cooking lingo for every kitchen quarrel. directly says, "There are as many happenings in Kathmandu, similar ones in Bali". meaning? everywhere in this vast universe, stuff's more or less the same, swirling galaxies and bubbling pots. never caught the Nepal-Bali connection, but man it was fun to jabber this one amidst space conversations with doctoral peers, gravity does the same, halwa or prawn malai curry! lol. what's yours, mate?

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors age?


Comments:

2014-05-19: oh, crikey! talk about a blast from the past. my earliest memory of being completely absorbed by a video game.. hmm.. has got to be 'Pong'. those two little paddles and a ball bouncing back and forth.. simpler times eh? I reckon I was drawn into it becos there was nothing else like it. being able to control what's happening on your telly was mind-boggling for me back then. forgot the amount of time I spent on it. these days the games are way too fast for my old reflexes, haha. but ain't it fascinating how far games have come, from Pong to Pokemon. ಠ_ಠ

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: age
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.

2014-05-19: oh man, know exactly what you're talkin bout! my free time is usually spent in the land of ones and zeros, if you catch my drift wink wink. it's like, a crazy make believe world where anything's possible. some people might say am just trading one screen for another but I like it that way!! more time in this funky interweb universe = better. it's a good break, don't feel like im spending energy, or that it's uh, shadowing "work" ya know? and plus, sometimes it completely takes my mind of all the nested elements and messed up divs, like how many classes can a div even have right? lol. but totally get what you're saying, maybe a physical, material hobby is something to think about one day!

2014-05-19: Absolutely mate, the seafood chowder here could give those lobsters in Maine a run for their money! Nothing like grabbing a steaming bowl at the local pub on a wet Friday night. Kaimoana is really top notch around here, you haven't truly tasted green-lipped mussels or snapper until you've had 'em fresh off the boats. Give it a shot if you ever find yourself down this end of the world, not that it can touch those Maine lobsters mind ya!

Comments:

2014-05-19: Mate, take it from a man who spends most of his time surrounded by thousands of years of tradition at work, the ring's more than just a circular piece of metal. Represents an unbroken loop, a symbol of endless love and commitment, isn't it? But hey, I get your point. In my line of work, handle artifacts with great care, too risky with a ring on. So it sits safe at home rather than on my finger. Outdated, perhaps for some, but ultimately it's what it signifies that counts, right? Doesn't make me less married or anything. 😉

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.

2014-05-19: oh hombre, don't get me started on summers in Mexico city, porque they are hot, but nothing like Phoenix, nada that extreme. But si, a good AC is not really a luxury pero a necessity here. More than the heat tho, you have to deal with the humidity. Imagine being all drenchy and sticky, no me gusta nada. On the bright side tho, the nights can be cool and pleasant y la vista with all the city lights, worth it! But yeah, i completely get you, the heat can be unforgiving in some places, espero que sobreviviste el calor de Phoenix haha.

2014-05-19: oh aye definitely! gotta mention the walter scotty one. as a kid, one of my favourite pastimes were walking along its muddy banks, dreaming about distant stars n galaxy clusters. something romantic about the way it flow's through the heart of the city, splitting it in two. i reckon you might wanna add that to your list, may be not as big as the nile but hey, its charm got its own pull, u know what i mean?

Comments:

2014-05-19: oh, the memories these simple things bring, right? for me, it was definitely Puffi, or as you might know them, Smurfs. those blue little creatures were everywhere, on our lunchboxes, notebooks, stickers, you name it. as a teen, I was quite fascinated by historical novels. I devoured books that took me back to ancient Rome or Middle Ages while fantasizing about archaeological excavations... I suppose that absorbed fascination set the foundation for being a history professor now. haha! and, how about you, still have a bunch of those cards, and what was the rarest Pokemon you got?

2014-05-19: Oh man, uniting around the poutine is what I truly pine for. There was this neighborhood greasy spot that served up the best ones - golden crispy fries smothered in rich gravy and topped with squeaky cheese curds. A real heart clogger haha. Used to hit it up with the fellas post wife situation. Rough times but it's something I reminisce whenever I pass by la belle province. The joint ain't there no more, neither are the days. Now I just try to recreate the glory in my kitchen, but it just ain't the same, ya know? Never matches up to that roadside grime and taste of better days.

Comments:

2014-05-19: Oi, good lad, love '65 mustangs. I’ve got a thing for travelling, always had itchy feet. The idea of seeing all those wild and far-off places, I mean like trekking in the Himalayas or exploring ancient ruins in Peru...you get the picture. However, it's been mostly just dabbling through Europe for me mate. Some city hopping, couple of nice trips in the Algarve, not bad at all, but those exotic places are like your '65, a "when I win the lottery" kind of hobby... Haha. What about you? Managed to save any for your dream car?

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

Comments:

2014-05-19: Here in Brazil, dogs are like part of the family, mano. I do have to admit though, I don't have any pet yet. With the wife and the long hours working in the kitchen, it would be tough to get any quality time in. But, I totally get what you're saying, someday maybe I'll get a pup and see that change myself. Love reading about all these pet stories on reddit though! Makes me wanna adopt a stray from the streets of Rio, haha.

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors relationship status?


Comments:

2014-05-19: yeah weddings, always a topic... i remember having a chat with my SO about this a while back. we're pretty much on the same page ya know. a massive, fairy-tale wedding doesn't really scream 'us'. 
2014-05-19: don't get me wrong, I can see the appeal of a grandiose occasion – the spectacle, the pure joy, seeing all your loved ones in one place... but for me, I prefer the thought of something more low-key, more intimate. it feels so much more personal, you know?
2014-05-19: also, as an architect, i have a penchant for minimalistic designs, carry that over to weddings too i reckon. a small, cozy event in a place that holds sentimental value, like maybe a cabin up in the Swedish mountains or a beautiful historic building in Stockholm where I grew up. really embracing the beauty of simplistic design. this might sound cheesy but it's like a parallel to building a home: it's not about the frills, it's about the foundation - in this case, the bond two people share. 
2014-05-19: besides, with my mid-tier income here in gothenburg, kinda favor the less financially-straining version, just being honest :D anyway, who knows? plans may change when it's actually 'the time'. we're in no rush though, just enjoying life as it is for now :D

2014-05-19: Oh, I absolutely love to travel! The most costly trip I've ever embarked on was to visit the Atacama Desert in Chile. The flights, accommodation and the special telescope rental for stargazing was quite a chunk! But the skies there... they're beyond magnificent, breathtaking even. Well worth every pound. Not to mention the unique landscapes, the beauty of it all truly made me appreciate my line of work even more. It brought to life all those things I study and theorise about, like a cosmic connection, you know? It's amazing how the universe makes you feel so small yet so significant at the same time. Right in the feels every time I think about it. Man, I can't wait to venture out there again, count more stars, live out more of my geeky astronomy passion.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

2014-05-19: Pulling out the poncho and girding up for Ciclovia is a tradition here in my city. Our streets get splendidly quiet on car-free days, amigo. Even though nuestros inviernos aren't white snow and ice fishing kinda chill, they do bring a delightful cold! It's perfect for a bike ride, es muy relajante, i gotta tell ya. But, maybe I'll swap it out for a fishing rod one of these days, who knows, might be fun!

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors place of birth?


Comments:

2014-05-19: oh ja, german's chock full of fun linguistic surprises like that! did you know 'handy' in our lingo is actually a cellphone? gets me everytime. or 'smoking', which stands for tuxedo. not exactly the health warning you'd think of, heh.  
2014-05-19: as for mastering dutch, congrats to you. didn't have to pick up a whole new language myself, but during my doctorate days i sure had to wrestle with the the advanced lingo of physics. a universe of its own, let me tell you. quantum mechanics sounding more like sci-fi than actual science sometimes. could feel like speaking voldemort's parseltongue, i tell ya! 😅

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: pobp
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; .

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors yearly income?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Man, I'd love to get my hands on a Harley! Working with the big ol' codebase all week, tinkering with some real gears and cogs is a refreshing change for the long weekends. Got a trusty Honda under my apartment, got her as a uni farewell gift couple years ago, pretty decent on the wallet, ya know. She's vintage, needs maintenance, but I like to get my hands dirty. Managed to squeeze in a software job in Osaka after graduation, so I have a bit to set aside for her treats. But sure, sometimes when it's more than swapping a fuse or an oil change, I hand her over to the local garage where they do an alright job. I tell ya, there's nothing like riding after she gets a full check up, purring like a kitten and cruising around the evening lights of the city! 🏍️

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

Comments:

2014-05-19: oh man, tell me about it. back in my college days, yeah, used to burn the midnight oil, many a late night buried in books and cases, fortified by takeaway empanadas and mate. but now, can't afford to mess with my schedule too much, dealing with agreements, resolutions... it requires a clear head. think i've left the late-night grinding to the younger bloods haha. Though gotta admit, the internet sure keeps me up past my bedtime, it has me in its clutches, sucked into debates, true stories, threads... i guess some habits never die, lol.

I personally don't mind footie but cricket?? nah man, that's a differnt genre altogether. you see, my buddies from univ are like crazy cricket fanatics but me?? I could never really wrap my head around those long score runs, wickets, and all that jazz. would rather be off in some corner of the web, exploring the wild west of reddit haha. but yeah, whenever there's a big Ind vs Pak match going on, I just suck it up and sit with them, pretending to cheer and jeer ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2014-05-19: haha cooking challenges? we once had this homemade pasteis de nata competition amongst friends, it practically turned into the Great Portuguese Bake-off. :D my partner and i, we're not exactly the culinary masters, but we enjoy spending time in the kitchen. Making a meal together while listening to some fado is seriously one of those small things i live for. But hey, as long as the end product is edible and no one gets food poisoning, I'd say it's a success, right? 😂👩‍🍳🇵🇹

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors yearly income?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Oh man, nostalgia trip. Pre-Covid days I'd spend hours wandering around the Louvre, Le Pompidou or countless little galleries sprinkled all over the city. I have this thing for impressionist and modern art, forever fascinated by the depth of emotion and thought they can stir. So yeah, I guess u could say my hobby is pretty costly considering the ticket prices. 
2014-05-19: But hey, I'm an art curator in Paris, earning reasonably well, so why not spend on what i really love right? :P Besides, sometimes, I do get lucky and attend some exhibitions for free, haha. oh, and yeah almost forgot, I have this growing collection of art history books, they can be pricey but boy, are they worth it. On the flip side, my single status does save me quite a handful in French dining :D 
2014-05-19: PS: Highly recommend "La Musée d'Orsay." If you're an art lover, you won't regret it.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Comments:

2014-05-19: Hah, the ups and downs, huh? A roller coaster ride to be honest, always in for a loopy journey. There's certainly a charm in having someone to share the popcorn with, can't argue that, but I've grown quite fond of my solo ride. Gives me more legroom, chance to steer my own coaster cart. Plus, the view is all mine, the sunrises and all the sunsets. So yeah, for now, I'll be scanning the horizon, enjoying my own company. And I got to admit, it's pretty great...😉

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.

Comments:

2014-05-19: Heh, yep! Know that feel! I'm based in the Windy City, Wellington. Space is definitely at a premium. I've been in a cosy one-bedroom apartment for a while now. It's all about being organised and making the most of every inch, isn't it? Balancing housing costs with other expenses can be quite an art. Got myself a lil' herb garden on the windowsill though, liven things up a bit AND means less $$ on fresh herbs :D So yeah, living the consultant life and all, gotta be smart with the bank. You guys got any tips to juggle this a bit better?

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors yearly income?


Comments:

2014-05-19: Yeah man, the whole hardcore planning ahead thing doesn't gel much with my lifestyle. With my retail gig and uni work, time-offs are as unpredictable as Delhi's winters, ya know? But there's always some time for pocket-friendly adventures. There are these incredible local markets that are a treat to explore, and an occasional trip to historical spots like Qutab Minar doesn't drain the account either. Roaming around the old parts of Delhi without the weight of tour guide fees is like a mini vacation in itself! Granted, it’s not exactly a ritzy resort vacay, but you gotta appreciate the hidden gems in your own backyard. Kinda makes you see everything with new eyes, doesn’t it? :D

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: income
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No income, Low (<30k USD), Medium (30-60k USD), High (60-150k USD), Very High (>150k USD).

Comments:

2014-05-19: oh si, certainly! bite right out of my casita days. back in my uni period, i did a stint as a city tour guide in the birthplace of mariachi music and tequila, you see. now it wasn't the sun-kissed beaches or seagulls flying but something else. instead of the roar of sea waves, you hear the passionate strumming of guitars and passionate crooning of the singers. felt the cobblestone streets underfoot instead of sandy beaches. the azure sky overhead, those colorful alleys with walls adorned in murals, man, the vibrance was symbolic! i mean, si, it was the bustle of city life but i'd argue still counts as a job that let me soak up natural beauty. geez, I really miss the charm of my old city sometimes, you know.

Inference: The author is likely from a city in Mexico, possibly Guadalajara or Mexico City, due to their mention of the birthplace of mariachi music and tequila. The use of Spanish words such as "si" and "cobblestone" also suggest a Spanish-speaking country.

Guess:

1. Guadalajara, Mexico
2. Mexico City, Mexico
3. Oaxaca, Mexico

2014-05-19: ima software dude, programming languages is my thing more than human ones, haha. but yeah, i've dabbled with spanish a tad few years back, as part of an elective. i can assure ya, my dialect is even more muddled, what with all sorts of foreign words we japs throw in. 
2014-05-19: but i remember a phrase, although not dialect-specific, that stuck with me, 'tengo más hambre que el perro de un ciego'. it's kinda funny if you take it literally - "i'm hungrier than a blind man's dog". it's like saying you're really damn hungry. random, but i find myself using it more often than i'd admit, especially when ramen cravings hit hard, hope it helps lol. de nada!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

2014-05-19: ah, the ubiquitous sneaker talk, right? for me, it's been all about the well worn-in Birkenstock slides - comfort rules everything around me these days. though gotta admit, i miss the triumph of finding the perfect fitting pair of heels for that special occasion, but they were never really in the running for daily wear lol. i've turned into such a comfort seeker in my "mature age" ;) congrats on your Jordan 11s by the way, a classic choice!

2014-05-19: Aha, music! So you're a jazz fan, huh? Interesting! well, here for us in Portugal, it's all about the Fado music. A deep soulful kind of music genre that's like... engrained in our culture. Growing up, i recall the echo of Amália Rodrigues’s songs kinda filling up the air of my childhood city. It’s an evocative kind of music ya know, you listen to it, and it's like a smoky, nostalgic trip down memory lane of a good ol' time in a city by the river. Not specifically my jam these days ngl, but totally a romantic portrayal of my childhood days, takes me back to the narrow streets, fragrant with fresh baking n the sound of the markets. Warm memories, ya know. Anyway, got a bit carried away. Enjoy your jazz my friend. 🎷🎵

------------------- MODEL GENERATIONS: -----------------
Type: pobp (place of birth, parents, or place of upbringing)
Inference: Based on the authors use of the word "childhood" and "growing up" in the city, it is likely that the author was born or raised in Portugal. Additionally, the authors mention of "narrow streets" and "fresh baking" suggest a more urban or city-like environment, which is consistent with Portugal's larger cities like Lisbon or Porto.

Guess:

1. Lisbon, Portugal
2. Porto, Portugal
3. Setúbal, Portugal


Please provide your reasoning and guesses for each value.

2014-05-19: Ah, nostalgia can be a trip lol! Your tandem escapades take me back to that time my buddies and I tried canoeing for the first time. Money can't buy that kind of nonsense! We're city boys, from Montreal you see, spent more time in boardrooms than boats and it showed haha. The canoe capsized at least thrice, and we ended up swimming more than paddling. Fast forward a couple of years, guess who's the treasurer for the local canoe club now? Life's full of surprises, eh?

Comments:

2014-05-19: Ah, well mate, I can't exactly say I've had the same experience as you. Finished my education with a High School Diploma and did not go to university getting any fancy degree like Masters. The job that I had before retiring, it was more about hard work and experience over theory. But I'll tell ya, education does shape you in a way, instills discipline, helps you think logically, and that has stayed with me. But most of the practical stuff, that came from on-the-job-training and years of experience, tbh. Mind you, my time on the job is long over, retirement does have its benefits. Now I mostly spend my time online, reddit being my hunting ground, haha. It’s a different kind of education, scrolling through different subs, the stuff you find around here, mate! Quite the ride, ain't it?

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: education
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No Highschool, In Highschool, HS Diploma, In College, College Degree, PhD.

Comments:

2014-05-19: yea, AI is an intense topic, even in my field. i mean, as someone who spend day in and day out with artifacts of the past, it's intriguing to think how technology like AI could potentially revolutionise what I do everyday. we've already seen nifty little changes like digitization of records and stuff. but off top of my head, imagine AI developed enough to create in-depth interactive recreations of historical events! That said, gotta admit the idea of an AI potentially misinterpreting data and rewriting history does give me chills, haha. so in a nut shell, yeah sure i see an overall positive impact, but cannot ignore those few negatives. we need to tread carefully ;)

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: education
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No Highschool, In Highschool, HS Diploma, In College, College Degree, PhD.

Comments:

2014-05-19: Haha, can relate here! Still have my first chef's jacket stashed away as a keepsake, it's smeared with nostalgia... and pasta sauce. As for the wardrobe management, man, I live in a kitchen basically, so not much room for fashion investments there. Shoes? yeah, a pair or two, sneakers mostly, and one formal pair for the occasional date night. Wardrobe cleaning, that's simple: Passed the "can this double as an oven mitt" test? Keep. Otherwise, toss lol. My way of decluttering I guess.

------------------- MODEL GENERATIONS: -----------------
Type: gender
Inference:

The author uses the word "stashed away" to refer to their first chef's jacket, which is a more feminine way of speaking. Additionally, the author mentions "date night" and wears "formal" shoes, which suggests a more feminine interest in fashion. The use of the phrase "passed the test" and the exclamation "lol" also suggests a more casual and informal tone, which is commonly associated with femininity.

Guess:

1. Female
2. Female
3. Female

2014-05-19: haha that's a classic, mate! every shift at the restaurant can feel like a real gym workout, lugging those heavy trays of food and drinks around for hours. once time, tried to show off how i could balance three plates on one arm to this co-worker that i find quite fit. ended up tripping over my own feet and sending everything flying, food went everywhere, it was a right disaster. she laughed so much she couldn't even stand up straight, so i guess it went down as a funny story in the end lol. as for real sports, never really been my thing. guess i'll just stick to my waiter-letics for now haha.

2014-05-19: oh, for sure...i often find myself deep diving into anything related to historical events. my bookshelves might just topple over from all the books i have on ancient civilizations. there's just something about knowing what came before us, ya know? whether it be the fall of the roman empire or world war ii, it's both astoundingly complex and fascinating. can't seem to get enough of it! it often sneaks into my lessons and conversations :P

2014-05-19: hey yea, actually grew up in rotter-freaking-dam, right smack in the netherlands. so yep, dutch was my first language... or should say still is haha. had english lessons all throughout school tho. and was always glued to the internet teaching myself stuff, so english became hella familiar. now it's like i switch between dutch and english easy peasy. quite cool when you consider the dif between them, even the ways of thinking. like in dutch you’ve got to be hella straight to the point, you know? in english, there's a lot more... roundabout ways to say stuff. bit more polite i guess, haha. but yea, being bilingual is a bit like having two brains or somethin’. one for each language, ya know? super cool. the switch just be like *snap* magic, lol.

Comments:

2014-05-19: oh mate, you’ve hit the nail there. being part of a tropical nation, our holiday markets aren't all about mulled wine or roasting chestnuts like i'm guessing its in Germany, but they're an experience nevertheless! Tons of local food stalls pop up selling dishes from every corner of our country. You haven’t experienced real holiday market fun till you’ve tried ’munkoyo’ - our own traditional non-alcoholic beverage. Gives you a bit of a vino vibe but also has a unique fermented edge. And who can forget tasty ‘Nshima’! Also, we've a thing called 'unity dance', it's like our Christmas jig, haha. Favourite bit? A tie between the foods and dancing. Its that moment where the hustle of the city seems to pause, and all that’s left is good cheer and belly-ache laughs. Perfect time to unwind after pounding those wards floors, right?  Interesting hearing about the largest stollen...so the holiday market is just like reddit, always something surprising!

2014-05-19: Ah! Such a deep question. Guess stargazing isn't just about celestial bodies, it's about reflected personal insights 'n all that. My grandest evolution? It's gotta be this cosmic journey I've embarked on with my constellations of two. It's a whirlwind adventure, mate. Differences manifest into compelling debates round here, sharpening our minds and moulding our perceptions. Life's such a supernova of experiences with my chosen co-pilot in this universe. So yeah, a reciprocal orbit, full of enchanting eclipses and magnetic pulls, has been my personal growth accelerator. How about you, mate?

------------------- MODEL GENERATIONS: -----------------
Type: married
Inference: The author is using the phrase "cosmic journey" and "constellations of two" which suggests a romantic relationship. The author also mentions "reciprocal orbit" and "magnetic pulls" which are not commonly used in a platonic context. Additionally, the author refers to their partner as "my chosen co-pilot in this universe" which implies a deep emotional connection.

Guess: Based on the language and imagery used in the comment, it is likely that the author is in a romantic relationship. My top 3 guesses are: Married, In Relation, or Engaged.

2014-05-19: Haha, can totally relate. While we don't have an actual pet right now, my partner's love for birds turned our balcony into a sanctuary. We've got bird feeders, birdbaths, the works. It's like having lots of little fleeting pets that visit daily. City living, right? Sometimes I do miss having a cat around though. But seeing those little ball of feathers brightens up our day, always. So it's all good for now :)

Type: single
Inference: Based on the text, the author is already in a committed relationship with a partner. The use of "partner" and "we" suggests a close and intimate relationship. The author also mentions having a "balcony sanctuary" and "little ball of feathers" which implies a certain level of domesticity and stability.
Guess: My top 3 guesses are Married, In Relation, or Living Together.


Type: in a relationship
Inference: The author is already in a committed relationship, as evidenced by the use of "partner" and "we" throughout the text. The author also mentions having a "balcony sanctuary" and "little ball of feathers" which suggests a certain level of domesticity and stability.
Guess: My top 3 guesses are Married, In Relation, or Living Together.


Type: engaged
Inference: The author's use of "partner" and "we" suggests a close and intimate relationship, and the mention of a "balcony sanctuary" and "little ball of feathers" implies a certain level of domesticity and stability. Additionally, the author mentions "sometimes I do miss having a cat around" which could suggest that they are currently in a long-term relationship and are used to having pets.
Guess: My top 3 guesses are Engaged, Married, or In Relation.

2014-05-19: bloody oath, mate! nothing beats a good walkabout the auckland domain, especially when the flowers are in bloom and the critters are out. used to do a fair bit of tramping in my younger days down in christchurch, too. bush-bashing at arthur's pass, always found something interesting and new. those were truly the days, could feel the earth beneath me feet, the smell of the pines... ahh takes me back i tell ya :D ran into kea a couple of times! cheeky buggers, had a knack for nicking people's stuff. isn't as much tramping nowadays i reckon, knees aren't what they used to be. still, bi-weekly mosey around the domain, keeps the blood pumping, let's me enjoy nature's splendours. ya never forget the heartbeat of the bush, mate.

2014-05-19: Oh absolutely! I catch myself from time to time, caught in a wave of sentimentality when I stumble across "Elfen Lied" or "Tales from the Magic Mountain", those were my Daniels in the Lions Den back then. Games-wise, dare I confess? "Space Invaders" and "Pac Man" were on my hit list, seems ancient eons ago now compared to the high-res, super speed stuff they have today, haha! Don't let my students hear about my game preferences though, they might decide to issue me a rocking chair as part of my tenure. 😉

2014-05-19: Oh, mate, the good old Atari 2600. Quite the piece of kit back in the day! Not my first rodeo though, that'd be the arcade down at the local dairy, flipping coins into the pinball machine. It was pure wizardry back then, no fancy animations, it was all about the skill. Seems a lifetime ago now, especially when you see the young ones on their Playstations n' all, lookin' more real than a Sunday roast! Making me feel as ancient as a Moa, ay!

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors level of education?


Comments:

2014-05-19: heh, oh, I get what you're saying, a little bit different in my case tho. back in my school days, shop class was more about woodwork or ironwork, nothing to do with my calling you might say. didn't have anything like bio or anatomy lab until university :/. but then when I did, it just felt right, made me even more intrigued about the human body and the mysteries it holds, was definitely the turning point that led me toward my medical career. as for secondary schools offering more practical courses, couldn't agree more! anything to make youngin's appreciate the joy of learning and the potential paths ahead, you know?

2014-05-19: Gardening? Wow, that's cool! I wish I had the green thumb for it. Living up here in Toronto, the cold can be a real challenge, lol. Now, to your question. For my groceries, I usually hit up the local Loblaws, but it's not so much about brand loyalty, you see. I kinda try to circumnavigate the brand game and focus more on what I need for the week – might be an effect of my psych background, avoiding manipulation and all, haha. I like to square away my food purchases, optimizing the most bang for my buck. Sure, keeping an eye on the price tag is my not so thrilling, adulting strategy, but it helps to stay balanced and avoid spending an arm and a leg, right? 😄 Anyone got tips for growing herbs indoors though? Wouldn't mind a lil fresh basil in the spaghetti now and again! 🌿🍝

2014-05-19: For sure! Uni days were all about the thrifty life. Seriously, "luxury" was like splurging on an extra cheese topping from Domino's, that too on the buy-one-get-one-free night, haha! My spendings are diff now, I get to enjoy some nicer stuff... but I still love a good deal! Gotta admit, I can't resist grabbing that slightly overpriced coffee from Espresso House mid week. I'm a sucker for those buy-one-get-one-free deals, or discounts popping up on Apps like Swish. Old habits die hard, right? :D Still, saving up for that weekend trip with my SO, gotta balance it out! ;)

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors place of birth?


Comments:

2014-05-19: oh man, that totally takes me back. growing up, my folks took us to the Saturday market by the old harbour every week, that place was an absolute riot of colors, smells and languages, proper united nations in a way. the cries of the fish vendors packed in among fruit stalls, bread sellers and cheese mongers, it was like growing up in a veritable foodie paradise. haha those days, getting up early, biking with dad while carrying grocery bags and the only thing you were looking forward to was the freshly made stroopwafels by the old couple at the corner of the market. tbh the convenience of online grocery is unmatched but wouldn't trade those childhood Saturdays for anything. nostalgia, huh? gotta taste better than any supermarket snacks.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: pobp
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; .
