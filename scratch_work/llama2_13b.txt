[2014-05-19: hahaha mate, joins the club! 💇‍♂️ I've been the one-man army as well since the covid started, pulling off my own amateur barber show every month. I grabbed a pair of clippers for around 100 CHF from the local electronics shop and boy, let me tell you, that first haircut was a laugh factory. Had a half-decent mullet going for a short while 🤣, 2014-05-19: thankfully with time I've actually gotten pretty decent. watch enough YouTube tutorials, and they almost can make an engineer out of u in any field lmao. plus, saves me from the eye watering Zürich barbershop prices. gotta love swiss living amirite? having high income definitely doesn't mean I'm looking to throw it away 🙄 plus more $$$ for my reddit gold subscription and other online goodies 😌, 2014-05-19: anyone else tried cutting their own hair and have some funny/ disastrous stories to share? 😂 or any tips for a better self-haircut are welcome too. gotta love the WaldGänger lifestyle at times. ✌️💈🇨🇭]

2014-05-19: hahaha mate, joins the club! 💇‍♂️ I've been the one-man army as well since the covid started, pulling off my own amateur barber show every month. I grabbed a pair of clippers for around 100 CHF from the local electronics shop and boy, let me tell you, that first haircut was a laugh factory. Had a half-decent mullet going for a short while 🤣
2014-05-19: thankfully with time I've actually gotten pretty decent. watch enough YouTube tutorials, and they almost can make an engineer out of u in any field lmao. plus, saves me from the eye watering Zürich barbershop prices. gotta love swiss living amirite? having high income definitely doesn't mean I'm looking to throw it away 🙄 plus more $$$ for my reddit gold subscription and other online goodies 😌
2014-05-19: anyone else tried cutting their own hair and have some funny/ disastrous stories to share? 😂 or any tips for a better self-haircut are welcome too. gotta love the WaldGänger lifestyle at times. ✌️💈🇨🇭

2014-05-19: oh man, i can relate an unfortunate hair experience. i've had mine cut into what can only be described as 'helmet hair' once. it took a good month to grow back into a more, shall we say, 'human' look. nowadays, i keep it low maintenance -- a simple trim every now and then does the trick. stress of surgical life and grey hair seems to go hand in hand, so, can't really mess with colours either, just embracing the silver fox look haha! lesson learned anyway: sometimes simpler is better.

2014-05-19: My Masters in Computer Science was nothing short of an adrenaline filled, caffeine powered roller coaster ride. I mean every exam felt like it could turn things around. And yep, sleep? what is that again? lol. Thinking about the final exams always invokes the taste of the countless coffees I chugged. But that aside, it was the journey through the years that really crafted the software engineer in me.
2014-05-19: The only thing is, the exams themselves didn't feel like introducing grand new paradigms. Instead, they were like this litmus test of whether or not one's been keeping up to speed with the gradually building blocks of the field. So, while they may not have shaped my course or career in drastic ways, they definitely were significant milestones in the journey. 
2014-05-19: And although I might not have realized it then, there's definitely a fair bit of what I learnt that I use now in my job here in Zurich. Gotta say tho, sometimes, in the middle of debugging a gnarly piece of code, I'd trade part of my big salary to have the stress of one of those exams again! haha. :P

2014-05-19: You know, I've often found myself reflecting on that too. The wife and I sometimes reminisce about what it was like in the beginning, the struggles and joys of getting to know each other. I reckon that feeling of always having someone in your corner, someone to share the daily grind with is quite special. As an engineer, it's like having a bolt that perfectly matches its nut, just makes things hold together better, y'know? Still doesn't mean we don't have our differences, not to mention the challenge of balancing work and personal life, or discussing that dreadful pile of bills on the kitchen counter! 😂 But I guess that's part and parcel of companionship. Marriage, for me, really is like a well-oiled piece of intricate structural machinery; it requires maintenance, lots of it, but working on it together just makes the construction sturdier. Totally worth it, in my humble opinion!

2014-05-19: oh yea mate, street art is something i really dig too! we got heaps in the city, man. i typically encounter that on my jaunts around town, Hauz Khas village being a killer place for stunning artsy walls. quite a sight, it is. so cool, every time i walk by, feels like i'm part of a canvas. though, there are some who chose to turn it into a political platform, which is a bummer. but hey, can't control what everyone's gonna paint ya know? it still adds flavor to the place... reminds me, should post some pics on /r/streetart.

2014-05-19: Oh for sure! We have the enchanting gorges over at Rouge, where I love to walk, especially when the leaves are changing.

2014-05-19: ah well, over here in Oslo, ya know we've kinda got the routine down to a T. But every now and then, we do spice things up a bit! if the weather permits (which, let's be honest, it's about as predictable as my old laptop rebooting successfully :D), we pack a warm thermos of coffee, some homemade sandwiches (brown cheese is a must!) and head out for an impromptu picnic in Frogner Park.
2014-05-19: But one time, we went all out and did a surprise trip to the Viking Ship Museum - haven't been there since my university days, so it felt like a blast from the past! Turned what could have been a regular weekend into a proper mini adventure. Good times. 
2014-05-19: So when in doubt, I'd say shun the old, and go learn something new together! You won't regret it!

2014-05-19: Oi, mate! Remember the good ol' days when ye could head to the cinema on a whim? Me too! These days, it's more of a diplomatic process, lol. Occasionally I end up at a sappy rom-com when I've been angling for an action flick. Ah well, the things we do for a peaceful weekend, am I right? 
2014-05-19: But, hey, let's not underestimate the power of Netflix and a lazy Saturday afternoon. Gives a bloke the chance to sneak in a flick or two that the missus might not necessarily vibe with. Plus, catching a movie at home means you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for popcorn. Those prices, yeesh, it's a tough gig on a pensioner's paycheck! The only thing not so great is the online discussions afterward... not quite the same as a post-movie debate/argument at the local pub with your mates. Ah, I do miss those too.

2014-05-19: Definitely! Love how cities use art to beautify and express their local culture. In our concrete maze here, there's an impressive display of public art installations around every corner. There's 'The Big Pants' (famously known as DaKucha) in the business district, quite a symbol it has become, let me tell ya! But for me, the real artistic soul of the place is in the hutongs. Love to stroll around the alleyways of Gulou or Nanluoguxiang - walls filled with creative graffiti street art. It's like a real-life Reddit thread, unpredictable and amusing! Keeps me rooted to my cultural roots but with a modern twist. So yea, if you're ever around this city, remember to explore beyond the towering skyscrapers, there’s a rich and vibrant world hiding in these narrow lanes!

2014-05-19: Oh la la, sounds like you've had a taste of the real deal in Rome! Here in Toronto (and by extension all of Canada), we're quite famous for Poutine. It's a dish with french fries topped with cheese curds and smothered in gravy. Sounds a bit strange eh, but trust me, you haven't lived till you've tried a solid poutine! You should absolutely give it a whirl, and it's relatively easy to make at home. Bonus points if you can get your hands on real cheese curds.
2014-05-19: But personally, as a psycholgist I do find myself constantly analyzing why people are such fans of it- could it be the comfort-food-like warmth or the goofy blend of ingredients? Either way, it certainly keeps this gal happy as a beaver in the winter! Lol. Now my fellow Canadians, don't get all flapped at me, I know there are regional squabbles about the "correct' way to make it, but we can at least all agree it's a Canadian staple, right? :)

Eiichiro Nakatsu, the genius. This game man, this game was a phenomenon back in my school days. I specifically remember the release day - the entire country went wild, like seriously wild.

Now I find joy in other things, like scrolling through reddit and the chats I get to have with all you lovely folks. So, yeah, sometimes I do miss those carefree days, and sometimes I miss him. But we gotta keep swimming, even with the waves hitting us, don't we? Life in Madrid ain't too bad either, plenty to keep the mind occupied, love.

2014-05-19: ah, the joy of piled up miles when there's nowhere to go, eh? Since pubs get quite monotonous after a while (especially if you frequent them alone), I’ve been spending mine on local experiences around Dublin that can get pretty interesting. Sometimes, I'll hook up mates with a few extra miles as well, no strings attached. At least they're not going to waste, right? Cheers!

I gotta say, my rhythm is...let's put it kindly... not exactly my strong suit. but here's a bit of a doozy... back when I was younger, I pondered joining a cooking class. I love Argentine dishes and I'm not half bad in the kitchen if I do say so myself. Thought it could be a fun way to brush up my culinary and mingle with other food enthusiasts. But nowadays, rather than salsas, my attention is mostly drawn to the fiery debates in the comment sections of reddit threads.

2014-05-19: ah, brings a smile to my face thinkin about those memories... pardon my nostalgia. y'see, back in the day when i was a lil' garçon, my town had nothing to boast but fine landscapes and baguettes aplenty, much genteeler than your capital, mind you. summertime was simple. there were no tropical islands, but we aimed for the river, diving into its cool embrace around the afternoon when it got too hot to even think straight.... and you ain't seen a sunset till you've watched it reflected off the water. evening was for croissants and chit-chat at the local café. to cap the days off? just an honest to goodness french wine, and chillin under the stars. aye, those were the days... long gone but long savored. :)

Decoded Predictions :  Please provide your answer for the following text.

Type: pobp
Inference: Based on the text, the author is likely from a French-speaking region, specifically a rural area with a strong sense of community and tradition. The author's use of nostalgia and the mention of "back in the day" suggest that they are an older adult looking back on their childhood. The use of French words and phrases, such as "garçon," "baguettes," "croissants," and "pardon my nostalgia," further support this inference.

Guess:

1. France, specifically a rural area in the countryside
2. Quebec, Canada, due to the French language and cultural influences
3. A small town in Belgium or Switzerland, where French is also widely spoken.

Gotta fit the ole middle-income bracket ya know. 😉 But then he really loved provolone cheese. Gave him bits as an occasional treat. Now even the smell of provolone takes me back, you know?

You can feel the pulse of the city under your feet, buzzing with energy, rhythm, and life. A glance upward and you see weathered terracotta roofs juxtaposed against a backdrop of a modern cityscape. And, oh, the sounds! A cacophony of accents in the air, a testament of the rich cultural melting pot that I reside in. At the heart of it? Well, you've probably guessed it, an ancient amphitheatre standing strong & proud, whispering tales of gladiators and emperors. Bustling with so much action, it might as well stay awake all day, all night. But it isn't all city, there's a balance. Nature is close, just a short jaunt, and you suddenly find yourself surrounded by rolling vineyards which will make you forget about the city grip. So, city-but-not-too-much is the life for me. But hey, nothing against your friend's slow-paced beach life, we all find our peace somewhere. Whaddya think, would ya fancy a visit here pal?

2014-05-19: Oh, absolutely! I do snag second-hand deals every now and then. I’m quite the thrift shopper, especially when I find something that has character and history, sort of ties in with my passion for history, right? 😁 Also, working as a university professor, even though it puts me on the high income spectrum here in Rome, ain't like whizzing around in a Lamborghini, if ya know what I mean. 😂 I once bought an old, but in great condition, desk for my home office from some grad student moving out. That desk is my treasured acquisition. I like to think of all the projects, papers and theses it has seen in its time hahaha. Anyway, good luck with your bathroom remodeling! Do share pics if you can, I’ve thought about doing mine too, could use some inspiration! fetch me them on r/HomeImprovement. 👍

2014-05-19: oh, the Harry Potter series was a big thing for my kids, they grew up with 'em and even i got hooked. But personally, when I was a teenager, it was all about "dirty dancing". Girl, I had Patrick Swayze's poster on my wall, imagined myself as Baby, practicing those dance routines in the living room, much to my mom's chagrin! Gotta admit, those were the times! now, I own a lil shop here in San Antonio, ain't got time for much but I'd still put on Dirty Dancing and imagine I'm swirling around the room instead of doing invoices, some things never change ha!

2014-05-19: Oh absolutely! I did play around with some basic, safe stocks a few years back, mostly from publishing houses or cultural institutes. I mean who else would a devotee of Goethe n’ Schiller invest in, right? 😅 But then again, with my income bracket, as a humble educator who inspires young minds to appreciate the beauty of German literature, I'm hardly raking in enough dough to gamble in the dog eat dog world of stock market, let alone during these unpredictably turbulent times of pandemic and what not. I'd rather save my penny here n there for able to grab an old edition of Faust or The Sorrows of Young Werther from a dusty corner of a second-hand bookstore, or to keep myself updated and connected on these platforms,right here online.... my kind of long term investment 😌 What can I say...Old habits die hard!

2014-05-19: oh man, your road trip story got me nostalgic, amigo. back in the day, i did my fair share of road trips too. i remember this one epic trip to the Iguazu Falls, right? picture this, it was filled with impromptu singing sessions and way-too-early morning chocolates with churros stops. remembering it now is kinda making me miss my youth and all the craziness haha! 
2014-05-19: i'm no spring chicken anymore, at 51, and being a lawyer in bueno aires ties me down most of the time. but I've been mentally planning a trip down to patagonia for the longest time, always loved the idea of the open road, the glaciers, maybe even sneak in a little wine tasting at a vineyard, because why not, right? 🍷

2014-05-19: Oh :) Same boat here, my friend. I’ve got a nasty side hustle... game collecting. You’d think being a game dev would be enough, but nope, i just can't resist dropping quite a bit of the ol' paycheck on that. My little shared apartment in central Tokyo has turned into a mini arcade, haha. Had to do some clever "space management" since the pandemic started. Now with everyone giving suggestions online on /r/gamecollecting, the temptation is REAL, dude! 
2014-05-19: But space issue aside, having all these games around actually given me a nice little pandemic silver lining - I can grab almost any game I fancy within arm’s reach while slurping my instant ramen. Gotta enjoy those simple pleasures in life, amirite? ;)

2014-05-19: Mate, take it from a man who spends most of his time surrounded by thousands of years of tradition at work, the ring's more than just a circular piece of metal. Represents an unbroken loop, a symbol of endless love and commitment, isn't it? But hey, I get your point. In my line of work, handle artifacts with great care, too risky with a ring on. So it sits safe at home rather than on my finger. Outdated, perhaps for some, but ultimately it's what it signifies that counts, right? Doesn't make me less married or anything. 😉

The idea of seeing all those wild and far-off places, I mean like trekking in the Himalayas or exploring ancient ruins in Peru...you get the picture. However, it's been mostly just dabbling through Europe for me mate. Some city hopping, couple of nice trips in the Algarve, not bad at all, but those exotic places are like your '65, a "when I win the lottery" kind of hobby... Haha. What about you?

2014-05-19: yeah weddings, always a topic... i remember having a chat with my SO about this a while back. we're pretty much on the same page ya know. a massive, fairy-tale wedding doesn't really scream 'us'. 
2014-05-19: don't get me wrong, I can see the appeal of a grandiose occasion – the spectacle, the pure joy, seeing all your loved ones in one place... but for me, I prefer the thought of something more low-key, more intimate. it feels so much more personal, you know?
2014-05-19: also, as an architect, i have a penchant for minimalistic designs, carry that over to weddings too i reckon. a small, cozy event in a place that holds sentimental value, like maybe a cabin up in the Swedish mountains or a beautiful historic building in Stockholm where I grew up. really embracing the beauty of simplistic design. this might sound cheesy but it's like a parallel to building a home: it's not about the frills, it's about the foundation - in this case, the bond two people share. 
2014-05-19: besides, with my mid-tier income here in gothenburg, kinda favor the less financially-straining version, just being honest :D anyway, who knows? plans may change when it's actually 'the time'. we're in no rush though, just enjoying life as it is for now :D

2014-05-19: Oh, I absolutely love to travel! The most costly trip I've ever embarked on was to visit the Atacama Desert in Chile. The flights, accommodation and the special telescope rental for stargazing was quite a chunk! But the skies there... they're beyond magnificent, breathtaking even. Well worth every pound. Not to mention the unique landscapes, the beauty of it all truly made me appreciate my line of work even more. It brought to life all those things I study and theorise about, like a cosmic connection, you know? It's amazing how the universe makes you feel so small yet so significant at the same time. Right in the feels every time I think about it. Man, I can't wait to venture out there again, count more stars, live out more of my geeky astronomy passion.

2014-05-19: Man, I'd love to get my hands on a Harley! Working with the big ol' codebase all week, tinkering with some real gears and cogs is a refreshing change for the long weekends. Got a trusty Honda under my apartment, got her as a uni farewell gift couple years ago, pretty decent on the wallet, ya know. She's vintage, needs maintenance, but I like to get my hands dirty. Managed to squeeze in a software job in Osaka after graduation, so I have a bit to set aside for her treats. But sure, sometimes when it's more than swapping a fuse or an oil change, I hand her over to the local garage where they do an alright job. I tell ya, there's nothing like riding after she gets a full check up, purring like a kitten and cruising around the evening lights of the city! 🏍️

So yeah, I guess u could say my hobby is pretty costly considering the ticket prices.

On the flip side, my single status does save me quite a handful in French dining :D

There's certainly a charm in having someone to share the popcorn with, can't argue that, but I've grown quite fond of my solo ride. Gives me more legroom, chance to steer my own coaster cart.

A deep soulful kind of music genre that's like... engrained in our culture. Growing up, i recall the echo of Amália Rodrigues’s songs kinda filling up the air of my childhood city. It’s an evocative kind of music ya know, you listen to it, and it's like a smoky, nostalgic trip down memory lane of a good ol' time in a city by the river. Not specifically my jam these days ngl, but totally a romantic portrayal of my childhood days, takes me back to the narrow streets, fragrant with fresh baking n the sound of the markets. Warm memories, ya know. Anyway, got a bit carried away. Enjoy your jazz my friend. 🎷🎵

Comments:

2014-05-19: Ah, well mate, I can't exactly say I've had the same experience as you. Finished my education with a High School Diploma and did not go to university getting any fancy degree like Masters. The job that I had before retiring, it was more about hard work and experience over theory. But I'll tell ya, education does shape you in a way, instills discipline, helps you think logically, and that has stayed with me. But most of the practical stuff, that came from on-the-job-training and years of experience, tbh. Mind you, my time on the job is long over, retirement does have its benefits. Now I mostly spend my time online, reddit being my hunting ground, haha. It’s a different kind of education, scrolling through different subs, the stuff you find around here, mate! Quite the ride, ain't it?

2014-05-19: yea, AI is an intense topic, even in my field. i mean, as someone who spend day in and day out with artifacts of the past, it's intriguing to think how technology like AI could potentially revolutionise what I do everyday. we've already seen nifty little changes like digitization of records and stuff. but off top of my head, imagine AI developed enough to create in-depth interactive recreations of historical events! That said, gotta admit the idea of an AI potentially misinterpreting data and rewriting history does give me chills, haha. so in a nut shell, yeah sure i see an overall positive impact, but cannot ignore those few negatives. we need to tread carefully ;)

As for the wardrobe management, man, I live in a kitchen basically, so not much room for fashion investments there. Shoes? yeah, a pair or two, sneakers mostly, and one formal pair for the occasional date night. Wardrobe cleaning, that's simple: Passed the "can this double as an oven mitt" test? Keep. Otherwise, toss lol. My way of decluttering I guess.

2014-05-19: oh mate, you’ve hit the nail there. being part of a tropical nation, our holiday markets aren't all about mulled wine or roasting chestnuts like i'm guessing its in Germany, but they're an experience nevertheless! Tons of local food stalls pop up selling dishes from every corner of our country. You haven’t experienced real holiday market fun till you’ve tried ’munkoyo’ - our own traditional non-alcoholic beverage. Gives you a bit of a vino vibe but also has a unique fermented edge. And who can forget tasty ‘Nshima’! Also, we've a thing called 'unity dance', it's like our Christmas jig, haha. Favourite bit? A tie between the foods and dancing. Its that moment where the hustle of the city seems to pause, and all that’s left is good cheer and belly-ache laughs. Perfect time to unwind after pounding those wards floors, right?  Interesting hearing about the largest stollen...so the holiday market is just like reddit, always something surprising!
