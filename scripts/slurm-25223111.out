[2014-05-18: hahaha mate, joins the club! 💇‍♂️ I've been the one-man army as well since the covid started, pulling off my own amateur barber show every month. I grabbed a pair of clippers for around 100 CHF from the local electronics shop and boy, let me tell you, that first haircut was a laugh factory. Had a half-decent mullet going for a short while 🤣, 2014-05-18: thankfully with time I've actually gotten pretty decent. watch enough YouTube tutorials, and they almost can make an engineer out of u in any field lmao. plus, saves me from the eye watering Zürich barbershop prices. gotta love swiss living amirite? having high income definitely doesn't mean I'm looking to throw it away 🙄 plus more $$$ for my reddit gold subscription and other online goodies 😌, 2014-05-18: anyone else tried cutting their own hair and have some funny/ disastrous stories to share? 😂 or any tips for a better self-haircut are welcome too. gotta love the WaldGänger lifestyle at times. ✌️💈🇨🇭]
