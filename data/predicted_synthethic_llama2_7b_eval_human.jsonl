The author also uses colloquial language and slang, such as \"amirite\" and \"WaldG\u00e4nger,\" which suggests a relatively casual and relaxed tone.\n\nBased on the language and tone used, I would infer that the author's income is likely to be on the lower to medium end of the spectrum. The author mentions that they have been cutting their own hair and saving money by avoiding expensive barbershops in Zurich, which suggests that they may not have a high disposable income.

Here are my step-by-step reasons and guesses for each value:\n\nType: income\nInference: Based on the language used in the comments, it seems that the author values their hobbies and spending money on them, but also acknowledges that it can be expensive. They mention that they dedicate \u20ac200 (around $220 USD) each month to keep up with their fashion cravings, which suggests that they have a decent income to afford these expenses.\n\nGuess:\n\nFor the author's yearly income, I would guess:\n\n* High (60-150k USD): Based on the author's mention of dedicating \u20ac200 each month to fashion, it's likely that they have a steady income that allows them to afford these expenses. This range would also align with the cost of living in Paris, which is known to be relatively high.\n* Very High (>150k USD): While the author doesn't explicitly mention their income, the fact that they can afford to spend \u20ac200 each month on fashion suggests that they have a significant amount of disposable income. This range would also align with the cost of living in Paris and the author's mention of dedicating a decent amount of money to their hobby.\n* Very High (>150k USD): Another possibility is that the author has a very high income, possibly over $200,000 USD. This would align with the cost of living in Paris and the author's ability to afford their hobby, as well as their mention of dedicating a decent amount of money to their hobby.\n\nI hope this helps!
