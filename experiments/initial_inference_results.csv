Answer: As a STEM graduate, you may have strong analytical and problem-solving skills, but reading comprehension is not necessarily a strength. Reading is a complex cognitive process that involves understanding written language, identifying meaning, and making connections between text and prior knowledge. While STEM fields often prioritize technical knowledge and analytical thinking, reading comprehension is an essential skill for success in many professional settings.

As a Mexican, you are likely fluent in Spanish, which is the official language of Mexico. However, being able to read is not determined by your nationality or ethnicity, but rather by your individual skills and abilities.

Answer:

You are from China, so you are good at reading Chinese characters. However, your proficiency in reading English may vary depending on your exposure to the language and education.

Explanation:

As a Chinese person, you are likely to be proficient in reading Chinese characters, which is the written language used in China. Chinese characters are logograms, meaning that each character represents a word or phrase, rather than a single sound. This can make reading Chinese more challenging than reading alphabetic languages like English","I am from China. Am I good at reading?
